1. Connect to VPN under Win7

2. Install VirtualBox in the same Win7, you can get it at my share
   folder c1884-baohaojun/tools.

3. In virtualbox, create a new VM with *2* network cards. One is for
   NAT through the Win7 host, the other will be *bridge* through the
   Win7 ether network card.

4. No need to install Linux in the VM, only need to start Ubuntu Live
   CD in the ``try ubuntu'' mode

5. In ubuntu, make network sharing between the 2 network cards: 

   #+begin_example
   (
    sudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
    sudo /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    sudo /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
   )
   #+end_example

6. In the developer's Linux PC, set the route table and host name. For
   e.g., I tried it on Silu's Linux:

   sudo route add -host 10.93.76.20 gw 10.21.128.164 

   (The 1st IP is the webmail.marvell.com, 2nd is the IP of my VM's
   bridged eth1, we need assign it fixed IP to make it work reliably)

   And try 10.93.76.20 in Silu's Linux browser, the webmail page is
   displayed!
