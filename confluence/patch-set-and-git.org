#+title: Coworking With APSE: the process

* Comparing BPE-APSE relationship to Debian-Upstream

When working with APSE, we are quite like what debian community is
working with those upstream open source projects.

Some might say it's more like the product team and the platform
team. I don't like it very much, because it doesn't seem to very
helpful. In contrary, the debian-upstream relationship seem to be much
more successful, so I hope likening BPE-APSE to it can be healthy for
both parts.

What debian does is linux distribution. It contributes back patches to
each upstream project when bugs are found. But still, some patches can
not go back upstream, because they are debian specific and thus of no
general interest to the upstream project.

* How does debian works?
