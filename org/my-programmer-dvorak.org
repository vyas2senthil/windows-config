#+TITLE: Switched to USA Pragrammer Dvorak Keyboard

After reading [[http://xahlee.org/index.html][xahlee]]'s articles on keyboards, I recently made 2 big
changes (and many other small changes because of the 2 big ones) to
the way I type. I switched from QWERTY to UPD (USA Programmer Dvorak),
and I switched my Control keys and Alt keys.

And how does it feel? Well, at first it was like pain in the ass. But
then it seems to get better and better.

And to make it even better, I bought a Microsoft Ergonomics 4000
keyboard for use at work!

Here's some hacking around this switch.

** Switching Chinese and English at the same time

As a Chinese, I also need to type Chinese using an Input Method, such
as Wubi. Now, I want myself to use the same UDP keyboard layout when
using IME, because it would be crazy if I switch back to QWERTY when
typing Chinese and stick to UDP when typing English...

But switching to UDP for my IME is even more painful. Because I am
using Wubi, instead of PinYin, and the secret about Wubi is you use
your muscle to memorize the encoding, so basically I just re-learned
Wubi. 

** Some changes to Emacs

Xahlee considered Progammers Dvorak no better than Simple Dvorak (he
tried UDP and then gave up), but I chose it anyway and have no plan to
change again. I kinda feel its not that a bigger differenc now that
both are Dvorak...

But Progammers Dvorak does give me some edge, considering the fact
that I also switched Controls and Alts (which is also one of the
advices by Xahlee).

This made a lot trouble with C-x and M-x. In the mean time, C-x got
separated with many of the combination keys that used to be typed with
the same hand as itself: C-x C-s, C-x C-f, etc.

Finally I found my solution (after searching Dvorak on EmacsWiki and
some inspiration): 

1. Switch C-h and C-x using keyboard-translate.

2. Stop using M- prefix altogether, use C-[ (the same effect as ESC)
   instead. Now Progammers Dvorak seem a much better choice than Simle
   Dvorak, because C-[ is very easy to type.

I tried to add more hacks, but finally stopped to reduce the
confusion, and because the above 2 is about enough.

** Using Progammers Dvorak under Windows.

Not that I use Windows a lot nowadays, but I do use it once in a
little while, and I don't want to be a fool when at it. So I need to
find a way to use Progammers Dvorak under Windows. 

Windows already provide a Simple Dvorak keyboad layout, and Programms
Dvorak also available on the net. But they are both incompitable with
IME. 

I found on the net people has used autohotkey to provide Simple
Dvorak, which does can be used at the same time with IME.

So I just wrote my Programms Dvorak version of autohotkey script. You
can get it [[http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/doc/dvorak.ahk][here]]. This ahk script was generated from 3 bash scripts,
which you can find [[http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/doc/dvorak.ahk.in][here]], [[http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/bin/gen-dvorak-programmer.sh][here]] and [[http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/bin/gen-dvorak-programmer-shift3.sh][here]].
