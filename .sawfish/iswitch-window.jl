;;; Commentary:

;; Incremental window search, similar to iswitchb.el in emacs.
;;
;; Default keys (change in iswitch-get-window; ideally we should have an
;; iswitch-keymap):
;;
;; C-s,A-s,TAB    find next matching window
;; C-r,A-r,M-TAB  find previous matching window
;; C-g,ESC        quit iswitch
;; C-u            clear input buffer
;; backspace      delete previous character
;; C-z,A-z        iconify window
;; C-h,A-h        shade window
;; RET            select window
;; 
;; Other keys insert themselves. A-s (or H-s, depending on your
;; modifiers) would be a good key to bind iswitch-window to; for example,
;;
;;   (bind-keys global-keymap "A-s" 'iswitch-window)
;;
;; The iswitch-window-with function also does something to the current
;; window. For example,
;;
;;   (bind-keys global-keymap "A-s" '(iswitch-window-with
;;                                    (lambda (w) (iconify-window w))))
;;
;; would iconify the currently focused window and focus the newly
;; selected window.

;; 1.4:
;; * Allow setting font and colors - karlheg
;; * Add a filter regexp to remove some windows from the list - karlheg
;; 1.3:
;; * Updated URL.
;; * Added iswitch-show-window-class variable.
;; * Fixed problem with undefined classes, thanks to Matt Tucker.
;; 1.2:
;; * Added patches, A-z, A-h, reverse cycling (A-r) and
;;   iswitch-window-with from Jens.
;, * TAB and M-TAB now do the same as A-s and A-r.
