Alt+Space bar is not working on my system, when I press it on a Explorer window, it will not bring up the system menu, and on an Emacs window, it will not invoke the just-one-space command.

To find what's going on, I shoot up spy++, and monitor all messages on all windows of my system. The messages are a lot to scroll, so to catch what happens when you press Alt+Space, you need press Alt+space and don't release it for a while, then the message generated by it will be shown to you. (Supposedly, you should have set the keyboard auto repeat speed to very high in Control Panel). And I found out it's producing language change messages. Once this is found out, it's only a few tweaking in the language setting in Control Panel to revive the Alt+Space key:-)
