  - memory leak
  - write into same folder as program, will cause permission issue under Win7.
  - can we please do not write temp files into the .blf folder? those folders maybe exist in share-folder  
  - will cause computer unable to shutdown after pull off usb cable when writing.

- flashing problem could be factory bottleneck. 
- 1-n flashing.
- RF Calibration, difficult to do in-depth development
- whole set testing, use SFFT, we will do development based on this tool.
- auto test and manual test, need be combined
- wifi/bt/fm/gps etc, test using grassroot method, no SNR test etc.
- test result database.
- Doctor Jia advise to add battery calibration and do SN write in early whole set current test.
- To enter different boot mode, need discuss further
  1. Test gpio is not a long term solution
- To discuss how the factory test station status is saved.
