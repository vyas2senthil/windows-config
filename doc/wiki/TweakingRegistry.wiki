#summary Win32 Registry Tools

= Registry Grep =

There is already a Registry Grep tool [http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Registry-Tweak/Registry-Grep.shtml here]. But I don't like it. I wrote my own regrep.py using python and pywin32. It's CLI version, I have no interest to make it GUI.

Usage is very simple:
{{{
$regrep.py "hello.*world"
}}}
will search that pattern in your registry. Read the code at [http://windows-config.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin/windows/regrep.py here]

= Registry Subst =

It's just one step further from regrep.py to regsub.py. In fact, I wrote regsub.py first, because I have a task to perform: I need to change the user profile folder from `c:\documents and settings` to `d:\profiles`, this way, after I re-install windows, I still have my user data and configuration files. I don't need to remember to backup before I reinstall.

I did it with:
{{{
$regsub.py 'c:.*documents and settings' 'd:/profiles'
}}}

Read the code at [http://windows-config.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin/windows/regsub.py here]

= Registry Open =

{{{
$regopen.py 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\org\antlr\works'
}}}
will open that key in regedit.exe.

The code is at [http://windows-config.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin/windows/regopen.py here].
