* Tools from UPE (Unix Programming Environment)


** 2, 3, 4, 5

*** The same script behave differently according to script name ($0)

Why? Because: 

- it improves code reuse, 
- reduce code duplication. 

  Duplication means maintenance cost.

*** It's very similar to busybox

* Make tools smart

** Smart requires memory (a.k.a., history)

*** bash history

Please learn to use:

- Ctrl-r
- Ctrl-s
- Alt-. 
- Alt-n
- Ctrl-j
- ... (bind -p)
*** cd history

*** re (Re-Exec)

It respects memory/history, but it also respects context (auto completion).


** Smart requires context-awareness (auto/programmed completion)

*** skeleton completion
