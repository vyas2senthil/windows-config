-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.8
July 15 2008

Dependencies:

* Update local copy of SemWeb and include it under GPLv3 instead of CC-by-2.0.

* Update beagle-settings-qt requirements: look for either qyoto.pc or qt-dotnet.dll

* Remove internal taglib-sharp. We now require that taglib-sharp be installed.

* Remove the build dependency of sqlite3-devel, 

* Fix our D-Bus requirements. System D-Bus is an optional requirement for beagled.
  Session D-Bus is a necessary requirement for "beagle-search --icon". Distributions
  should make beagle-search depend on something that starts session D-Bus at login
  (e.g. KDE3 does not automatically start D-Bus at login).

* Explicitly use -lX11 to build libbeagleuiglue.so. Fixes #540120.

* Require gtk+/# >= 2.10.

* Remove the build dependencies of libgnome-2.0-dev and libgnomevfs-dev.

Features:

* Add a SemWeb based adapter for querying beagle using RDF.
  Strictly experimental and enabled only with --enable-rdf-adapter.
  (http://beagle-project.org/RDF)

* Add the GMail backend related options to beagle-settings-qt.

* Add a BibTex filter based on the command line program 'bibparse'.
  bibparse is a run-time requirement and can be found in the btparse package.

* Add infrastructure and command-line tools to create and manage
  static indexes for removable sources.
  (http://beagle-project.org/Static_Indexes#Indexing_Removable_Medium)

* Add a crawl-rule for indexing executables in /usr/bin, /bin etc.
  Add beagle-crawl-system [--list] [crawl-<name>] options to list the system
  indexes and selectively update only one system index.

* Add support for snippets for remote beagled query.

* Add support for KDE4 konqueror history.

* Show a drop-down list in beagle-search to choose search categories.
  This was previously hidden in the menus. Use BEAGLE_SEARCH_SCOPE
  environment variable to allow users to create custom categories.

* Add menu options to beagle-search to start and stop beagled and
  show index statistics.

* Enable the Open-With context-menu in beagle-search results.

* Include a python script to grab shortcut keys from beagle-settings
  (distributed under GPL3).

Bugfixes:

* Focus the search entry is there are no results initially. Fixes #529540.

* Fix a regression where searching applications and other system wide indexes
 were disabled by default in beagle-search.

* Update Evolution backend for the new Evolution-Sharp API. Fixes #526685.

* Use the correct protocol for evolution-tasks "task:///...". Fixes #530624.

* Handle corrupt config files. Fixes #532308.

* Fix parsing of Opera history cache. Fixes #533529.

* If the firefox extension does not find ~/.beagle, show the message in the
  icon tooltip instead of showing the disruptive alert. Fixes debian #463922, bnc #385513.

* Handle rogue backends if they start throwing lots of errors. This will
  save the log files from getting flooded with unnecessary exceptions.

* Fix the spreadsheet filter which was broken since 2007!

* Correctly generate URIs for child-indexables (e.g. archive contents,
  docbook entries). Fixes #535020.

* Fix the docbook filter to not return unnecessary matches when only
  one docbook section matches the query.

* Show an error dialog if beagle-settings encounters an unhandled exception.
  This gives a better feedback to the user. Fixes #541134.

* Always show the filename separately in the beagle-search results. Show the
  filename instead of document title for pdf, odt etc. files whose titles are mostly
  unset or auto-generated.

* Do not index javascript: pages in the firefox extension.

* Properly parse Pidgin log files with smilies; these lines used to throw
  an exception earlier.

* Support KMail-3 in KDE4. Fixes #540153.

* The FileSystem backend now correctly handles filenames in a
   non-utf8 locale if MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS is set to the platform encoding.
  Fixes #440458.

* Fix a bug where beagled sometimes returns less than 100 (max-results) results even
  though more results are available.

Version 0.3.7
24 April 2008

* Work around a mono feature/bug [1] where mono might hang trying to get a gdb
  backtrace in the event of a native library segmentation fault. This is
  specially important for the evolution-sharp bug [2] due to which beagled might
  crash when the EvolutionDataServer backend is enabled. For some users, the
  crash resulted in a non-functional but hanged beagled that in turn hanged
  programs trying to contact beagled like gtkfilechooser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.6
19 April 2008

* Fix regression in 0.3.4 (content of Tomboy notes were not indexed). For bug-fix backports please merge r4656.

* Use an icon from the Tomboy project for displaying note tiles in beagle-search. Package this icon with beagle-search.

* Add a GMail and Google Apps email live search backend. See http://beagle-project.org/Live_GMail_Search for details. This does not index the emails itself but directly queries GMail. Apart from a limited functionality, this will also submit user queries to Google (note to people concerned with privacy). This backend can be packaged separately by bundling GoogleBackends.xml and GoogleBackends.dll. The backend is disabled by default.

* Add option to store and retrieve GMail password from KDE Wallet.

* Show query-domain selection menu in beagle-search. Replace "--network yes|no" with "--domain ..." options in beagle-query for full choice of query domains.

* Update Firefox extension to Firefox 3.0.

* Add a 'locate' based backend to supplement the FileSystem backend. If enabled, results from 'locate' will also be returned except the ones which are already returned by the FileSystem backend. The FileSystem backend also has to be enabled for this backend to work. This is only meant to be used when FileSystem backend is still crawling or if results from the entire file system is desired; due to several limitation in locate itself and in this backend, this backend is disabled by default.

* Update F-Spot files from latest F-Spot svn trunk. Update the JPEG filter to use the managed Tiff parser instead of libexif. Drop libexif dependency.

* Display network search related options in beagle-settings.

* Fix the network-service backend.

* Catch the galago dllnotfoundexception and prevent a crash (relevant for Debian libgalago1.0-cil package).

* Add 'blocate' - a 'locate' like tool to query static indexes without running beagled. It is a wrapper to beagle-static-query and can be configured using blocate.conf (globally at /etc/beagle and locally at ~/.beagle/config). blocate and beagle-update-index form the beagle powered replacement for locate and updatedb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.4
23 March 2008

* Need Mono at least 1.2.6; recommended at 1.9

* GMime-sharp recommended at least 2.2.16

* Add API to set the number of words and the total length of the snippets.

* Move to Lucene.Net 2.1 (backported a faster analyzer and other improvements).

* Move query mapping (e.g. mappings for ext:, genre:) to a separate user editable /etc/beagle/query-mapping.xml (global) and ~/.beagle/query-mapping.xml (local). beagled needs to be restarted to read the new mappings.

* Expose a Hide/Show DBus interface for beagle-search.

* Firefox search bar plugin to query using beagle's web interface.

* Add a tool beagle-static-query to query beagle without starting beagled. This is mainly meant for static indexes (like locate with the system index, like mod for a monodoc index).

* Lots of beagle-search beautification.

* Add a query mapping "filename:" to query for filenames and words in it (e.g. match My in MyFile.txt and My_File.txt).

* Enable the TeXinfo filter.

* Add a filter for .info files (including gz/bz2/lzma compressed info files). manpages crawl rule now contains /usr/share/info.

* SIGUSR2 will now also print runtime debugging information of beagled.

* Use the new Mono.Unix.UnixSignal if built with mono 1.9. This should remove the last of the beagled/index-helper hangs during shutdown.

* Add the missing files for the firefox extension sidebar.

* Show a better error message if ~/.beagle is not found when the firefox extension is started (should help debian #463922).

* Fixes #514252 (evo backends now explicitly reference glib-sharp)

* Fixes #509487 (use LANG=C when external programs are started from any filter)

* Fix build with mono 1.9 and gnome-sharp 2.20 (#514252, #518220)

* Fix property change indexing (renames, moves etc.) which broke in 0.3.0

* Fix our filter matching algorithm to correctly choose filters in the right order and move to the next one if one filter fails.

* Fix file leak in ebuild filter.

* Clean up some tmp files which could have left behind during a corner case.

* Fix a startup crash in the Pidgin backend if the Pidgin log directory is absent during beagled startup.

* Check for msgfmt in ./configure before building.

* Fix glib-critical warnings in libbeagle (and python bindings) when snippets with empty fragments were sent by beagled.

* Fix some bugs in snippet due to which valid matches were not included in the snippets.

* Timeout in libbeagle if connection to beagled takes more than 5 secs. This will prevent hangs in konqueror/gtkfilechooser if beagled is hanged for some reason.

* Do not throw error if scheduler information and index information is empty since they can actually be empty.

Version 0.3.3
2 February 2008

* Prevent few potential crashes in EvolutionDataServer backend.

* Fix a null reference exception in imlogviewer when no buddy alias is set.

* Fix beagle-search to allow filetype: queries.

* Fix filtering of media files by Totem and MPlayer.

* Fix the URIs in Konqueror web history backend to be of the right form. Also prevent it from flooding the buffer cache during initial crawling.

* Fix autostarting of beagle-search in Gnome (fixes #507786).

* Fix a potential crash in EvolutionMail backend due to an incorrect and obsolete type casting (merge patch from Debian).

* Disable building static indexes for all the static indexes (merge patch from Debian).

* xdgmimecache.c contained a fix for bugs.freedesktop.org #12512 which is not present in the GTK+ copy. Revert the change that removed the fix.

* Add a view in beagle-search to show the current index information.

* Add a new tile in beagle-searcj for manpages. Several fixes to the documentation tile as well. Searching documentation is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing --search-docs to beagle-search.

* Add an LZMA (7zip) based filter for lzma compressed man pages.

* Prevent beagle log manager from printing the same exception repeatedly. Instead only print the first line followed by a "(Repeated)". This will make beagle go easy with the log file size.

* Add a Qt UI for beagle-settings using Qyoto.

* Add an advanced query syntax "inuri:" to match data with query word in the uri. The implementation is backend specific and usually relevent for web history and bookmark backends.

* A partial implementation of "inuri:" for the filesystem backend to query for files in a particular directory (not recurive). The option to inuri: could either be a word in the name of the directory or the file:/// uri of the directory. Live queries (where a new directory is created that matches the inuri value) are not supported for inuri queries against the filesystem backend.

* Add a firefox sidebar to the firefox-beagle extension. The sidebar will allow querying in indexed webpages and bookmarks. The sidebar requires the web interface to be enabled (for querying from local machine).

* Use Sqlite prepared statements in textcache and file attribute databases.

* Add configure options to control whether to always use the internal taglib-sharp or an external taglib-sharp. Useful for source based distributions.

* Use "--indexing-delay -1" as an option to start beagled in query only mode.

* Add an environment variable BEAGLE_FORCE_GC to do a forceful collection in beagled (disabled by default).

* Enable system-wide manpage index.

* Port beagle to LINGUAS (fixes #510172).

Version 0.3.2
27 December 2007

* Use Hal to monitor battery and AC power. Earlier we monitored a fixed set of files in the /proc filesystem. Now we require NDesk-DBus.

* Fix building with mono 1.2.6 [bgo #503639].

* Add a couple of Avahi specific missing files.

* Fix several bugs in handling exclude directories and patterns in the Filesystem backend.

* Fix a crash in the Nautilus backend when it tries to index temporary files [bgo #504192].

* Fix monodoc and manpages filter. Add support for gzip and bzip2 compressed manpages.

* Fix a bug in beagle-build-index where new files would not be indexed.

* Fix --enable-deletion in beagle-build-index. Set --enable-deletion for system-wide indexes.

* New Empathy backend.

* Store file size for files from the filesystem, in archives and in email attachments.

* Show a larger snippet in the tooltip in beagle-search.

* Allow users to bookmark webinterface searches.

* Also display the time of recently modified results in the webinterface.

* Add --write-xml and --read-xml options to beagle-config to enable non-C# programs to read and set config options.

* Show documentation results in beagle-search when started with --search-docs option.

* Add system-wide crawl rules for manpages and monodoc files. Keep them disabled by default.

* Show the system-wide indexes in the backend chooser of beagle-settings.

Version 0.3.1
10 December 2007

* Fix a crash sqlite3 users will face at startup when upgrading from 0.2.x.

* Workaround a problem in which some HTML emails could cause
 the index-helper to take lots of memory and go into an infinite loop
 [bgo #501803].

* Fix a bug in which beagle-settings would grow wide on long directories
 [bgo #469298].

* Hide the Avahi service settings if Avahi was not enabled at configure time.

* Drop our Images.dll assembly; instead load Tango icons from the icon
 theme and stock icons [bgo #398533].

* Workaround a crash in mono when hostname is 16 characters or longer.

* Update video tiles layout in beagle-search.

* Use bash for all our scripts. Makes it possible to run beagle-index-info where
/bin/sh is not linked to /bin/bash.

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.0
1 December 2007

* Many speed and memory performance improvements in both indexing and
  searching throughout the code.

* Support for date queries in the query language.  For example,
  "date:2006" will return documents from 2006.  "date:2005.04" will
  return documents from April 2005.  Ranges are also supported.  For
  example, "date:2006.05.01-2007" will return all documents
  between May 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.

* Rewritten Thunderbird backend, which uses a Thunderbird extension to
  send data to be indexed to the Beagle daemon.

* All new Firefox and Epiphany extensions.

* Experimental network searches.  You can search between multiple
  Beagle daemons, which can be automatically discovered through
  Avahi.  Daemons can also be manually configured, useful for WAN
  searches.

* Experimental web interface to the Beagle daemon.  An AJAX interface
  allows users to search for data through their web browser.

* Support for additional external metadata on previously-indexed
  documents.  This allows new backends or external applications to
  attach metadata that can then be searched on.

* New Nautilus metadata backend, implemented on top of the new
  external metadata support.  Indexes Nautilus emblems and notes, and
  adds search keywords for these.

* Snowball analyzers are now used to process text.  This is the first
  step toward language specific analyzers.

* New Opera history backend.

* Individual backends can now be enabled and disabled using the
  beagle-settings tool.

* Ignored file patterns (like *.o, *.a, *~, etc.) are no longer
  hardcoded, and can be set through the configuration.

* Changes to our TextCache to use a sqlite database for small files
  and on-disk files for larger ones.  This makes the disk usage of the
  TextCache much more efficient.

* Use Mono's updated Mono.Data.Sqlite code, rather than our own hacked
  up copy of the old Mono.Data.SqliteClient code.  As a result of
  this, we now require sqlite3.

* A new configuration system, which allows system administrators to
  set defaults in /etc/beagle/config-files.  This also makes it easier
  for backend and filter authors to add their own configuration
  settings.

* Use taglib-sharp (replacing unmaintained entagged-sharp) for
  extracting metadata from audio files.

* An option to turn off aggressive indexing of data while the
  screensaver is on.

* A new classification for files -- the "file type" -- which
  classifies similar types together.  For instance, PNGs, JPEGs, and
  GIFs all have file type "image".  These can be searched using the
  "filetype" keyword.

* Now store snippets for emails.

* New extended attribute format.  Beagle now uses a single extended
  attribute, user.Beagle, to store all of its information.  The old
  format is migrated to the new one as files are reindexed.

* Queries are run serially rather than in parallel, since most of the
  search overhead is in disk IO.  Reduces memory usage considerably,
  and helps prevent disk thrashing on large searches.

* Print out warnings about possibly insufficient inotify watches, and
  don't periodically recrawl directories that don't have them.  Fixes
  the 100% CPU indexing loop bug of death.

* Various tweaks to the scheduler, to make throttle large numbers of
  tasks better.

* Handle large batches of file deletions (ie, an "rm -rf" on a
  directory) and file additions (ie, untarring into a watched
  directory) in a much more efficient manner.

* Require evolution-sharp 0.12, which implies Evlution 2.8 or 2.10
  because of API changes to the library.

* Some experimental support for XMP sidecar files.

* A new QueryPart for searching explicitly for URIs.

* Support for excluding KMail folders.

* Support for indexing Evolution notes.

* Refactor the indexing of IM conversations.

* New TeX filter.

* Structure snippets rather than returning them as HTML strings.
  This gives application authors considerably more control over how
  to display them.

* Scan the first 4k of files to determine their MIME type in addition
  to looking at the file extension, and choose the better match.

* PDFs are now included when indexing system documentation.

* Improvements to indexing files inside archives.  Now all extracted
  files are handled in the index helper process, removing a costly
  round trip.

* Redirect crash logs from Mono into the Beagle log files.  They were
  previously lost and users had to reproduce problems with --fg.

* Add many more keywords to the query language; run beagle-query
  --keywords to see a full list.

* Lots and lots of indexing and searching bugfixes.  Too many to
  count.

Version 0.2.18
27 August 2007

Notable changes:

* Build and run against evolution-sharp 0.13.3.

* No longer recrawl directories if we can't set up an inotify watch.
  This fixes the looping bug of death when the screensaver kicks in.

* Greatly improve indexing overhead with the beagle-build-index tool.

* Display a warning in the log if the number of inotify watches runs
  out.

* Fix a problem in which beagle-search wouldn't work after a daemon
  restart.  [bgo #463803]

* Fix a bug in which processing large numbers of maildir files could
  cause beagled to run out of file descriptors.  [bgo #466891]

* Add support for the ~/.liferea_1.2 directory to the Liferea
  backend.  [bgo #426573]

* Add support for PDF keywords, and allow colons in PDF metadata.
  [bgo #463003]

* Ignore legal.xml files in the Docbook filter, since they're largely
  content-less and frequently duplicated.

* Fix the SQL used to retrieve tag information from the Digikam DB.
  [bgo #454656]

* Improve error reporting throughout.

Version 0.2.17
8 May 2007

Notable changes:

* When extracting files from archives, save the temporary files with
  the appropriate file extensions (rather than .tmp) so that
  extension-based MIME type detection works correctly.

* Handle phrase queries that contained stop words much better.
  For example, previously "no dice" would return no hits.

* Make the archive filter much more robust. [bgo #415056, bnc #244490
  and #228718]

* Add --disable-on-battery to beagle-build-index, add support for
  it in beagle-crawl-system, and enable it for the documentation
  index, since it takes a while to build. [bgo #383789]

* Add --disable-text-cache to the Beagle daemon, to disable storing of
  text for snippets.  This saves substantial amounts of disk space at
  the expense of showing snippets in the UI.

* Fix a bug in which deleted files weren't removed from the text cache
  properly.

* Fix prohibited date queries (ie, -date:20070505) in most cases.

* Fix an infinite loop on certain SVG files. [bgo #407564]

* Fix an infinite loop on some truncated JPEG files. [bgo #405372]

* Limit PDF tools to 100 megs mapped memory. [bgo #335461]

* Add more well-known locations for Docbook files, since their MIME
  type often cannot be determined beyond generic XML types.

* Use the TOMBOY_HOME environment variable if available. [bgo #332102]

* Fix the CHM filter. [bgo #408047]

* Fix opening of Konversation hits in beagle-search. [bgo #408101]

* Shut down the daemon sooner if requested in the middle of a large
  batch of files being indexed.

* Many other minor filter and backend fixes.

* Redirect low-level stdout and stderr to the log file, rather than
  just .Net streams so that Mono crashes are logged and saved
  somewhere useful.

* Lower CPU priority in the Beagle daemon, for instances where we get
  a little CPU hungry.

* Add a new index verification process if stale lockfiles are left
  behind for whatever reason (usually an index helper crash).  The
  process is rather CPU intensive, but overall will be less painful
  than purging the index and reindexing everything.

* Watch the X connection more closely, fixing a bug in which the
  daemon wouldn't exit when the user logged out if it didn't have any
  work to do.

* Always start the daemon with --replace, so that no more than one
  copy is running per user.

* Speed up the returning of results by about 10%.

* Remove separate crawling and indexing threads from
  beagle-build-index, causing it to be slightly faster and use a lot
  less memory.

* Speed up beagle-index-info by returning cached document counts, and
  not starting up a helper process to get them.

* Fix an infinite loop problem with empty OpenOffice documents. [bgo
  #427256, #435694]

* Better handle PDF files which spew tons of warnings with
  pdfinfo. [bgo #425150]

* Display the first Nautilus emblem on file results, and fix an
  uncommon memory leak in the beagle-search UI.

* Remove the Mono --debug argument from beagle-search, saving about 2
  megs RSS and making startup faster.  Also remove it from things like
  beagle-build-index.

* Fix a bug in which mail attachments which didn't have a file name
  weren't being displayed in the UI.

* Fix bugs in counting the total number of results in the UI.

* Fix a crash caused by empty buddy icons. [Launchpad #93064]

* Fix a crash caused by empty icons from Liferea. [bgo #428336]

* Fix an exception caused by Evolution IMAP folders with commas in
  their names. [bgo #432417, lp #108957]

* Redirect MS Word extractor script output to stderr so that it
  doesn't interfere with the indexing process.

* Fix some file modification date handling issues in the daemon.

* Exit the beagle-crawl-system cronjob if beagle-build-index doesn't
  exist. [bgo #370943]

* Always set the process name in beagle-extract-content.

* Add application/xhtml+xml as a MIME type for the HTML filter.

* Sync our copy of xdgmime with the upstream GTK+ version.

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.16
7 February 2007

Notable changes:

* Roll back the Mono requirement to 1.1.13.5.  The .NET 2.0 support
  should be good enough in it, and it gives us access to more released
  distros (like Ubuntu Edgy and SUSE 10.1).

* Change our method of setting up limits on external extractor
  processes, because running JITted code in a child process sometimes
  causes runtime deadlocks.  [bgo #402065]

* Fix a problem in our Sqlite schema where Beagle could loop crawling
  directories that started with zeros.

* Correctly handle filter versions while indexing, so that if a filter
  is upgraded to index more information, those files will be
  reindexed.

* Fix a problem where KMail folders were not being indexed.  [bgo
  #391647 and #401767, bnc #238161]

* Fix an issue with the file system backend reporting that it is
  indexing even after it has finished.

* Fix an issue with the Evolution mail backend reporting that it is
  doing the initial crawl even if it is only reprocessing a changed
  mailbox.

* Fix an issue with the Konversation backend always reporting that it
  is indexing, prompting the info box in beagle-search.

* Many robustness improvements to the Konversation backend.

* Fixes to the image filter (extracting JFIF comments and IPTC data,
  among others).

* Fix a potential deadlock on PDF files that cause pdftotext to spam
  output to stderr.

* Fix the SVG filter to handle undeclared namespaces gracefully.
  [bgo #404787]

* Handle JavaScript comments inside HTML files properly.

* Workaround certain archive files that cause SharpZipLib to loop
  infinitely.  [bgo #402280]

* Fix bugs caused by a change in behavior after switching to the .NET
  2.0 profile, mostly date-related.

* Fixed a problem where beagle-crawl-system was not being properly
  generated at configure-time.  [bgo #401504]

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.15
25 January 2007

Notable changes:

* Beagle now users the .NET 2.0 profile and is compiled with gmcs,
  giving us access to generics.

* Support added for Linux's relatively new SCHED_BATCH scheduler
  policy.

* Infrastructure added to limit helper programs in terms of CPU time
  and address space using setrlimit(2).

* Disabled building the Thunderbird backend by default; it's too
  memory hungry and buggy at this point.

* Added KOrganizer and Konversation backends.

* Many memory usage improvements, especially with IMAP accounts in the
  Evolution mail backend and when doing queries.

* A rewritten and massively improved RTF filter.

* The MS Word filter has been moved into an external process,
  improving service reliability tremendously.

* Dozens of improvements to the filter code, including single
  instantiation of filter objects, reading smaller chunks of data from
  files, and other bug fixes.

* Fixed a problem where file attributes stored in the sqlite DB
  weren't removed if we later stored them in extended attributes.

* Removed the rarely-used Google backend, since Google stopped
  providing API keys.

* Install a greatly improved beagle-dump-index tool, for examining the
  data inside indexes.

* Many rendering improvements and bug fixes to the GUI.

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.14
14 December 2006

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* Added the infrastructure necessary to handle indexing of archive
  files.  (Debajyoti Bera, Daniel Drake)
* Fix many issues with dates because .NET 1.1 was interpreting the
  dates as local time, not UTC.  (Bera)
* Indexables are no longer marked as indexed until all of its children
  are indexed first.  (Bera)
* Add infrastructure to signal clients when we're doing the initial
  index.  (Joe Shaw)
* Changes to how child indexables are dealt with in the index.  (Bera)
* Work around a bug in Mono 1.2.1, so that Beagle doesn't incorrectly
  think your home directory is on a remote filesystem like NFS.  (Joe)
* Use the XDG autostart specification to autostart the daemon, and
  deprecate the old --autostarted flag.  (Joe)
* Fix a URI comparison problem that would cause files to be repeatedly
  reindexed.  (Bera)
* Fix a bug in the tokenizer so that "001234" is tokenized as "1234".
  (Bera)
* Tokenize longer numbers, like international phone numbers.  (Bera)
* After we store child indexable streams in the helper, close them
  rather than letting the GC do it for us.  (Joe)
* Don't set the "source" on indexables if they are already set.  This
  allows indexing service clients to set their own "source" names.
  (Bera)
* Added a handler for SIGUSR2 to the helper process, which will print
  out what file it is currently filtering.  Should help debugging 100%
  CPU issues greatly.  (Joe)
* Greatly improve logging in the daemon and helper.  (Joe)

Backends:
* Support child indexables in the file system backend.  (Bera)
* Report progress percentages in the Evolution mail backend.  (Joe)

Filters:
* Added a new archive filter, to handle zip, tar, gzip and bzip2
  archives.  (Joe, Veerapuram Varadhan, Bera)
* Limit the archive filter to only index 30 files inside archives for
  now, to avoid excessive disk usage.  (Joe)
* Added Scribus filter.  (Alexander Macdonald)
* Fix a crash and clean up the code in the SVG filter.  (Alexander)
* Fix a potential crash in the HTML filter.  (Bera)
* Use the current encoding when decoding URLs in the HTML filter.
  (Bera)
* Add text/troff to the list of supported MIME types in the man page
  filter.  (Joe)
* Turn on snippeting in the man page filter.  (Joe)

Bindings:
* Fix a logic bug in libbeagle that would cause responses to get lost
  if different complex messages were sent to the daemon.  (Joe)
* Print out the response in libbeagle apps if ENABLE_XML_DUMP is
  defined.  (Joe)
* Set the correct time zone info in BeagleTimestamp.  (Bera)
* Add example code for using the indexing service APIs.  (Bera)

Tools:
* Only show the timestamp in beagle-extract-content if it's valid.
  (Joe)
* Fix a problem in which child indexables from archives weren't being
  cleaned up in beagle-extract-content.  (Bera)
* Only show the number of total hits if we're in verbose mode with
  beagle-query, so that scripts can still easily deal only with URIs.
  (Joe)
* Add support to beagle-settings to handle autostarting the daemon and
  UI with the XDG autostart spec.  (Joe)
* Show the percentages of progress in beagle-index-info for the
  backends that support it.  (Joe)
* Remove dead webservices code from beagle-settings tool.  (Joe)
* Fix a problem in which passing in --disable-directories to
  beagle-crawl-system would override --disable-filtering.  (Joe, 
  Pat Double)

UI:
* Show an informational box when the daemon is in the process of
  indexing the user's data.  (Lukas Lipka, Joe)
* New tile to show files inside archives.  (Joe)
* Added a status bar, and display in it the total number of matching
  documents and the number that are currently displayed.  (Joe)
* Fix some rendering ugliness in the details pane if you resized it.
  (Joe)
* Add support for xdg-open if present.  (Joe)
* Fix the build so that Thunderbird was correctly opened from tiles.
  (Kevin Kubasik)
* Fix a crash in the image tile if the file didn't have an extension.
  (Kevin)
* Fix web tiles opening the handler for the MIME type, rather than the
  handler for the URL.  (Kevin, Joe)
* Fix a crash on right-click when the "Open With..." menu would have
  been blank.  (Joe)
* Use the XDG autostart spec to autostart beagle-search, and deprecate
  the old --autostarted method.  (Joe)
* Fix a potential crash in the image tile in the unlikely event that
  we'd attempt to composite the F-Spot logo on top of a standard MIME
  icon.  (Joe)
* Don't scale up RSS feed icons.  Liferea stores icons mostly at 16x16
  or 32x32, and those look terrible.  (Joe)

Memory optimizations:
* Fix a big leak in which we were leaking Lucene IndexReader
  instances.  This substantially reduces memory usage.  (Joe)
* Plug a leak in which QueryWorker instances were never removed from a
  static hash table.  (Joe)
* Don't store full Hit objects in the QueryWorker's URI hash table,
  since they're never used and hold references on a lot of objects.
  (Joe)
* Fix a leak of URIs in LuceneFileQueryable, which is the base class
  for most of the smaller backends.  (Joe)
* Fix a leak in which the list of all the Evolution accounts were
  stored for each folder.  (Joe)
* Avoid some unnecessary boxing in Lucene, reducing memory usage.
  (Joe)
* For all our non-tokenized fields, turn off storing norms in the
  Lucene index.  This will save disk and memory usage for those
  fields.  (Joe)
* Make the code in the IndexerRequest class a little better about
  object allocations.  (Joe)
* Fix an issue where characters were boxed every time we processed a
  URI.  This heavily reduces memory allocations.  (Joe)
* Use UTC when calculating load averages, to avoid uncessary
  allocations related to timezones.  (Joe)
* If --heap-buddy or --heap-shot are passed to the daemon, assume
  --debug-memory.  (Joe)
* If running with --heap-shot and the RSS increases by more than 5% or
  5 megs, or the Mono heap size increases by more than 10%,
  automatically send SIGPROF to the daemon to generate a memory
  snapshot.  (Joe)

* Updated Norwegian bokmål translation.  (Kjartan Maraas)
* Updated Spanish translation. (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)
* Updated Swedish translation. (Daniel Nylander)

Everything else:
* Sync our xdgmime with upstream.  (Bera)
* Only check for wv1 if we have gsf-sharp.  We need both for MS Word
  filtering.  (Joe, Bera)
* Only build the po directory if we're building the GUI.  (Joe)
* Update the build system to use gnome-common's gnome-autogen.sh if
  it's available.  If not, use our own included copy.  (Joe)
* Require automake 1.8 to build.  (Joe, Pat, Max Weihle)
* Build against Mono's included SharpZipLib 0.84, instead of the older
  0.60 version.  (Joe)
* Fix an issue with the cron scripts not being included in the
  tarball.  (Joe)
* Only check for gtk-doc if libbeagle is enabled.  (Joe)

------------------------------------------------------

  files can take a while and we don't want to affect other user apps.
  (Joe Shaw)
* Change the IO priority code to automatically fallback from trying to
  set idle priority to lowering best effort.  (Joe)
* Fix a bug in which the short circuiting code would cause not all
  results to be found.  (Debajyoti Bera)
* Fix a bug in remote filesystem index synchronization when home is on
  a remote filesystem but BEAGLE_STORAGE is set.  (Joe)
* Add means to get the total number of Lucene matches that are found.
* Fix broken UTC/local time mismatches in C clients.  (Bera)

  work is processed before the final cleanup and exit.  (Joe)
* Further improve output logging in the daemon and index helper.
  (Joe)

Backends:
* Add "email" keyword mapping to KAddressbook backend.  (Bera)

Tools:
* Use the watch command for beagle-status instead of our own loop in
  the shell script.  (José Carlos García Sogo, Joe)
* Don't quote the query string in beagle-query, it breaks advanced
  query syntax.  (Bera)

Translations:
* Added Arabic translation.  (Djihed Afifi)
* Updated German translation.  (Hendrik Richter)
* Updated Hungarian translation.  (Gabor)
* Updated Norwegian bokmål translation.  (Kjartan Maraas)

  for translation aren't marked as such.  (Joe)

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.12
1 November 2006

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* Drastically reduce memory usage of beagled and beagled-index-helper
  at startup by changing how certain pluggable components are
  detected.  Filter and backend authors, see IMPORTANT NOTE below.
  (Joe Shaw, Debajyoti Bera, Kevin Kubasik)
* Don't run Beagle in Mono with the --debug flag unless --mono-debug
  is passed into beagled.  This saves memory and fixes leaks.  (Joe)
* Tokenize emails and hostnames when indexing.  (Bera)
* Add back in Hangul Jamo support to Lucene, which was lost in our
  upgrade to 1.9.1.  (Young-Ho Cha)

* Stop doing unnecessary extra work in the KAddressbook and KNotes
  backends.  (Bera)
* Don't deal with email addresses separately in various backend and
  filters, since they are handled by the tokenizer now.  (Bera)

Tools:

  themselves aren't indexed.  (Joe)
* Set the default applications and documentation crawl rules to use
  --disable-directories.  (Joe)

Translations:

------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.0
September 15, 2005

Daemon/Infrastructure:
* New and vastly improved Lucene infrastructure. Highlights include:
  + The indexing and querying code has been split.  The entire
    architecture is much cleaner, and we have been able to eliminate
    several horrible hacks that had been introduced for the benefit
    of the file system backend.
  + The index is now semi-transactional; we can make now make some
    guarantees about the index and the beagle-specific filesystem
    metadata not getting dangerously out-of-sync in the event of a
    crash.
  + It is now possible to efficiently modify certain index properties.
  + Hits now are returned in time-order, not score-order.  Scores
    are still available, though will not agree with the old scores
    in some cases.
  + Querying is faster, our query language is better, and the query
    semantics are much more sane.
  + We are much more intelligent about when we optimize the Lucene indexes.
  + Indexables are now abstract indexing requests, and IndexableGenerators
    can thus now manipulate the index in arbitrary ways.
  + Many, many bugs have been fixed.
  (Jon Trowbridge, Joe Shaw, Fredrik Hedberg, Daniel Drake)
* Many bugs involving queries have been fixed, and the query semantics have
  changed.  Querys now default to 'AND', not 'OR'. (Jon, Joe)

  queries. (Joe)
* When using a remote home directory, create the unix domain socket
  locally since some filesystems don't support them (like smbfs). (Joe)

  addressbooks and calendars with change notification, based on Varadhan's
  work in evolution-sharp. (Joe)

  accounts that would use large amounts of CPU at startup. (Joe)
* Fix a bug where IMAP accounts against Exchange servers weren't being
  indexed. (Joe)

  but evolution-sharp isn't. (Joe)
* Fix a date bug where some results would display as happening "-N days
  ago". (Joe)
* Thumbnail file hits. (Debajyoti, Joe)
* Don't run the crawler as part of cron.daily, because it can happen at
  any point during the day and it's an expensive operation.  Add a crontab
  entry which runs at 4:30 am. (Joe)

  to different modifiers (num lock, scroll lock, alt, etc.) and fixes many
  "BadValue" crashers. (Alex Graveley, Joe)
