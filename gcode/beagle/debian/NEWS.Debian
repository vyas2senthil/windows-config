  System wide indexing
  --------------------

  From this version, system wide indexing is enabled. By default documentation 
  in /usr/share/doc, and /usr/gnome/help, as well as applications are going to
  be indexed daily. What is going to be indexed is controlled by crawl-* files
  in /etc/beagle directory.
