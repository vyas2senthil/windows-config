The author of Firemacs is Kazu YAMAMOTO <kazu@Mew.org>

****************************************************************
*
* To make the .xpi package
*

  On the top directory of firemacs:

	% sh make.sh

  "work/firemacs-x.y.xpi" will be created.


****************************************************************
*
* To use this sources directly, instead of .xpi
*

  1) Find the profile directory of Firefox.

     On Mac, it is "~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/"

  2) Find the firemacs directory under the profile directory

     Suppose your profile name is "profile.default", it would be
     "Profiles/profile.default/extensions/{e98b7313-167d-48c6-89be-bc514d6de8d9}"

  3) Change directory to the firemacs directory.

  4) Remove all files on the firemacs directory using:

	% rm -rf *

  5) Create three files: "components", "chrome", "install.rdf",
     "chrome.manifest"

  5.1) Make symbolic link to the "components" directory of Git:

	% ln -s $GITDIR/components

  5.2) Make symbolic link to the "chrome" directory of Git:

	% ln -s $GITDIR/chrome

  5.3) Copy the "install.rdf" file from Git:

	% cp $GITDIR/install.rdf .

  5.4) Create the "chrome.manifest" file whose contents are:

----
overlay	chrome://browser/content/browser.xul	chrome://firemacs/content/statusbar.xul
content	firemacs	chrome/content/
skin	firemacs	classic/1.0	chrome/skin/
----

  6) Your modification to the source files will be in effect when you
     restart Firefox.


****************************************************************
*
* Generating files in the "chrome/content" directory
*

  "config-name.js","keybinding.js", and "config.xul" under the
  "chrome/content" directory are automatically generated.

  Automatic make tool is in the "chrome/content/db" directory.

  - "firemacs.yml" contains keybiding information in the YML style.
  - "make.hs" will create these three files above from "firemacs.yml"
    and "config.xul".

  "make.hs" is written by Haskell. To compile and run it, type in the
  "chrome/content/db" directory:

	% runghc make.hs
	Generating "../config-name.js"... done
	Generating "../keybinding.js"... done
	Generating "../config.xul"... done
