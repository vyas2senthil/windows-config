Each element of the alist is a jira server name.  The CAR of each
element is a string, uniquely identifying the server.  The CDR
of each element is a well-formed property list with an even
number of elements, alternating keys and values, specifying
parameters for the server.

     (:property value :property value ... )

When a property is given a value in org-jira-serv-alist, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user
variable (if any) during syncing.

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set:

  :url                     soap url of the jira server.
  :username                username to be used.
  :host                    hostname of the jira server (TODO: compute it from ~url~).

All the other properties are optional. They over-ride the global variables.

  :password                password to be used, will be prompted if missing.
